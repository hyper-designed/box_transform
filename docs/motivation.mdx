# Motivation

We, [Saad Ardati](saadGithub) and [Birju Vachhani](birjuGithub), created
[Box Transform](boxTransform) and [Flutter Box Transform](flutterBoxTransform) to make it easy for anyone to create 
resizable and draggable rectangles in their Dart and Flutter projects. We know how frustrating it can be to have to 
reimplement the same functionality multiple times. That's why we created these packages after needing to implement 
resizable and draggable boxes over 3 separate times in [Codelessly](codelessly).

These packages represent the culmination of our knowledge and experience in creating resizable and draggable boxes in
[Flutter](flutter) in a natural and accessible way. We're excited to share our work with others and hope that it can 
help save time and simplify projects.

[Box Transform](boxTransform) is a **pure-Dart** base package that allows you to programmatically handle box resizing 
and dragging without relying on [Flutter](flutter). It provides highly flexible, programmatically resizable and 
draggable boxes that can be used in any [Dart](dart) project.

[Flutter Box Transform](flutterBoxTransform) is a Flutter package that builds on top of [Box Transform](boxTransform), 
providing a state-friendly API for easily implementing **resizable** and **draggable** boxes as [Flutter](flutter) 
widgets. With [Flutter Box Transform](flutterBoxTransform), you can convert the pure-Dart models to **Flutter-relevant** 
models and use its feature-complete API to quickly build your own **resizable** and **draggable** boxes.

Whether you're working on a **pure-Dart** project or a [Flutter](flutter) project, we hope that 
[Box Transform](boxTransform) and [Flutter Box Transform](flutterBoxTransform) can help you easily create the best 
possible version of a **resizable** and **draggable** box for your project.
