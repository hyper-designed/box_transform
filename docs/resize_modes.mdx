title: Resize Modes
---

The `ResizeMode` enum represents different types of resizing modes that can be used to determine how the rectangle should
be resized. The modes available are:

## ResizeMode.freeform

This is the default mode where the rectangle can be resized freely without any constraints. This mode is usually used
when no modifier keys are pressed.

## ResizeMode.scale

This mode is similar to `ResizeMode.freeform`, but it preserves the **aspect ratio** of the rectangle.
This means that if you resize the rectangle from the right edge, it will also resize from the left edge, but the aspect
ratio will be preserved. This mode is usually activated when the `SHIFT` key is pressed.

## ResizeMode.symmetric

This mode is similar to `ResizeMode.freeform`, but it is symmetric with respect to the **center**
of the rectangle. This means that if you resize the rectangle from the right edge, it will also resize from the left
edge. This mode is useful when you want to resize the rectangle from the center. This mode is usually activated when
the `ALT` key is pressed.

## ResizeMode.symmetricScale

<Image alt="Symmetric Scale Resize Mode" caption="Resizing w.r.t the center while preserving aspect ratio" src="assets/resize_symmetric_scale.gif" />

This mode is similar to `ResizeMode.scale`, but it is symmetric with respect to the **center**
of the rectangle. This means that if you resize the rectangle from the bottom-right corner, it will also resize from the
top-left corner while preserving the **aspect ratio**. This mode is usually activated when both the `ALT` and `SHIFT` keys are
pressed.
