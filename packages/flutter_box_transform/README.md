[Flutter Box Transform](github) is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) package that allows you to programmatically 
handle box resizing and dragging using Flutter widgets. It provides highly flexible, programmatically 
resizable and draggable boxes that can be used in any Flutter project. It uses [Box Transform](github) APIs internally
to provide flexible and easy to use interface for Flutter projects.

## Features

* 📏 **Dimension Constraining:** Set maximum and minimum constraints to keep boxes within specific boundaries while resizing.
* 🔁 **Flipping Mechanics:** Advanced positional-flipping when resizing hits extreme values with hard constraints.
* 🔒 **Drag Clamping:** Clamp boxes inside a parent box to contain them within a specific area.
* 🎨 **Flexible Resizing Modes:** Choose from four different resizing modes for more flexibility in how boxes are resized.
* 📍 **Customizable Anchor Points:** Define resizing corner-handles to anchor different parts of the box when resizing.
* 🎨 **Customizable Handles:** Use default resizing handles or define your own custom handles.
* 🚀 **Easy Integration:** Integrate Box Transform into your flutter project with ease using widgets.
